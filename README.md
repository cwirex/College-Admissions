**University recruitment system based on Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm**

## Abstract
This paper presents a centralized college recruitment system based on Gale Shapley's deferred acceptance algorithm, which aims to increase the efficiency and transparency of the recruitment process and provide a fair solution in this regard

## Results
- The use of the Gale Shapley algorithm for the recruitment problem posed proved to be effective and efficient. 
- For randomly generated data of 43 universities, 3427 majors which included about 30000 places for almost 270000 applicants submitted. 
- The algorithm, taking into account their reported preferences and obtained baccalaureate results, made enrollments obtaining about 97% overall efficiency in which 66% of candidates were enrolled in the direction of their first choice. 
- The results were obtained in about 1054ms. 

## Final notes
- The web application and the algorithm handling enrollment were correctly implemented and tested, and the presented system concept can be further developed and used as a modern alternative to current solutions.
- The simulation results presented in the paper show clear potential for implementing the algorithm in real life.
